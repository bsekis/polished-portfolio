# react portfolio

## description
My web development portfolio made in React, featuring 5 projects. Uses a Header and Footer component across all pages, React Router for navigation, and a Project component used for all projects. 

## technologies
Made with [React](https://reactjs.org/) using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/) and [Bootstrap's React Components](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).

[Particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/) used for particle effect in the background.
